# Superpowers

Superpowers is a complete software development methodology for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable skills and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

> [!NOTE]
> This marketplace carries a local customization, currently version `6.3.0-sonsu.2`.
> It keeps the upstream worktree detection and creation workflow while routing durable documentation by purpose,
> keeping implementation plans in chat or Git-ignored scratch space, requiring explicit
> Git authorization, applying TDD to production behavior changes, and keeping direct Git, ticket,
> and PR artifact requests outside its branch-integration menu. See
> [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) and the local [skill-routing policy](../../docs/architecture/skill-routing.md).

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it has clarified the design, it shows the proposal in sections short enough to review. Durable documentation is created or updated only after the existing docs and proposed destination have been reviewed with you.

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan in chat, or in Git-ignored scratch space when execution needs a file. Each task selects verification appropriate to its change: red/green TDD for production behavior, and syntax, path, link, loader, or consuming-command checks for documentation, metadata, and simple configuration.

Next, execution stays inline unless task commits are explicitly authorized and subagent-driven development is applicable. A design, document, or implementation approval does not by itself authorize staging, committing, pushing, or creating a PR.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.

## Commercial Services

If you're using Superpowers in enterprise and could benefit from commercial support, additional tooling, or managed spending, please don't hesitate to drop us a line at sales@primeradiant.com.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install Superpowers separately for each one.

### Claude Code

Superpowers is available via the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers)

#### Official Marketplace

- Install the plugin from Anthropic's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
  ```

#### Superpowers Marketplace

The Superpowers marketplace provides Superpowers and some other related plugins for Claude Code.

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
  ```

- Install the plugin from this marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
  ```

### Antigravity

Install Superpowers as a plugin from this repository:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
```

Antigravity runs the plugin's session-start hook, so Superpowers is active from
the first message. Reinstall with the same command to update.

### Codex App

Superpowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- In the Codex app, click on Plugins in the sidebar.
- You should see `Superpowers` in the Coding section.
- Click the `+` next to Superpowers and follow the prompts.

### Codex CLI

Superpowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- Open the plugin search interface:

  ```bash
  /plugins
  ```

- Search for Superpowers:

  ```bash
  superpowers
  ```

- Select `Install Plugin`.

### Cursor

- In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

  ```text
  /add-plugin superpowers
  ```

- Or search for "superpowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### Devin CLI

- Install the plugin from this repository:

  ```bash
  devin plugins install obra/superpowers
  ```

- Update to the latest version with:

  ```bash
  devin plugins update superpowers
  ```

### Factory Droid

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/obra/superpowers
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  droid plugin install superpowers@superpowers
  ```

### Gemini CLI

- Install the extension:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions update superpowers
  ```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
  ```

### Grok Build CLI

Superpowers is available via the [official Grok plugin marketplace](https://github.com/xai-org/plugin-marketplace).

- Install the plugin from xAI's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  grok plugin install superpowers@xai-official --trust
  ```

- Or open the marketplace in the TUI, search for Superpowers, and install it:

  ```text
  /marketplace
  ```

### Kimi Code

Superpowers is available in Kimi Code's plugin marketplace.

- Open Kimi Code's plugin manager:

  ```text
  /plugins
  ```

- Go to `Marketplace` > `Superpowers` and install it.

- Or install directly from this repository:

  ```text
  /plugins install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
  ```

- Detailed upstream docs: [docs/README.kimi.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/b36e0829c6d0140e93cfef2ca599b1b07d4a7797/docs/README.kimi.md)

### OpenCode

OpenCode uses its own plugin install; install Superpowers separately even if you
already use it in another harness.

- Tell OpenCode:

  ```
  Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
  ```

- Detailed upstream docs: [docs/README.opencode.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/b36e0829c6d0140e93cfef2ca599b1b07d4a7797/docs/README.opencode.md)

### Pi

Install Superpowers as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/obra/superpowers
```

For local development, run Pi with this checkout loaded as a temporary package:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/superpowers
```

The Pi package loads the Superpowers skills and a small extension that injects the `using-superpowers` bootstrap at session startup and again after compaction. Pi has native skills, so no compatibility `Skill` tool is required. Subagent and task-list tools remain optional Pi companion packages.

### Hermes Agent

Install Superpowers as a Hermes plugin from this repository:

```bash
hermes plugins install obra/superpowers --enable
```

Restart any active Hermes sessions after installing. Note: Hermes has no
post-compaction hook, so a very long session that compacts over its first
turn loses the bootstrap — start a fresh session if skills stop triggering.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections, and classifies documentation impact. Durable docs change only after their destination and scope are approved.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Writes the plan in chat by default, records documentation and commit authorization state, and gives every task exact files and proportionate verification.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Executes inline by default. Task-based subagent execution is available only when the user explicitly authorizes its task commits.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates for production behavior changes, code defects, and behavior-sensitive refactoring. Documentation, metadata, and simple configuration use proportionate verification instead.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Re-runs the applicable final verification, then presents merge, PR, or keep options. Discard is available only after an explicit request and confirmation.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Superpowers is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support.

1. Fork the repository
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, being sure to fill in the pull request template.

Skill-behavior tests use the drill eval harness from [superpowers-evals](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/superpowers-evals/), cloned into `evals/` — see `evals/README.md` for setup. Plugin-infrastructure tests live at `tests/` and run via the relevant `run-*.sh` or `npm test`.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Superpowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.

## License

MIT License - see LICENSE file for details

## Visual companion telemetry

Because skills and plugins don't provide any feedback to creators, we have no idea how many of you are using Superpowers. By default, the Prime Radiant logo on brainstorming's optional visual companion feature is loaded from our website. It includes the version of Superpowers in use. It does not include any details about your project, prompt, or coding agent. We don't see your clicks or anything about what you're building. This helps us have a rough idea of how many folks are using Superpowers and which version of Superpowers they're using. It's 100% optional. To disable this, set the environment variable `SUPERPOWERS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to any true value. Superpowers also honors Claude Code's `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` opt-outs.
